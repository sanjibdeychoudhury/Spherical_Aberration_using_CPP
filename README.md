# Spherical_Aberration_using_CPP
Here I have written a code to determine Spherical Aberation Of A lens System using C++ Programming Language.
This code is written by me. As C++ approximates automatically from 5 digits after the decimal, You will not find all the values to be super Accurate. But, You will get a value enough to give a rough approximation.
